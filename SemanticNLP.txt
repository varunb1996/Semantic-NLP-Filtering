Step 1- Technique used
Use regular expressions to search for combinations of keywords directly in the Title and Abstract fields, focusing on terms related to both deep learning (e.g., "CNN," "neural network") and virology/epidemiology (e.g., "virus," "outbreak").
To make the approach semantic-friendly, combine terms in specific patterns (e.g., (deep learning|neural network) AND (virology|virus|epidemiology)) and check that both types of terms co-occur in the same text context.


        Why it works?
Simple keyword-based filtering would pull in many irrelevant results (e.g., articles mentioning "neural network" but unrelated to virology).
This heuristic-based filtering minimizes irrelevant matches by ensuring co-occurrence of target keywords.


Step 2- Technique used
For Text Mining: Look for keywords related to NLP (e.g., "natural language processing," "text analysis").
For Computer Vision: Look for image-related terms (e.g., "image processing," "CNN," "segmentation").
If both are present, classify as Both; otherwise, use Other.

        Why it works?
Avoids complex models by using domain-specific keywords and simple logic, which is highly interpretable and efficient.

Step 3- Technique used
Define a set of common method names (e.g., "CNN," "RNN") and use regular expressions to extract mentions in the abstract.

        Why it works?
This heuristic-based approach identifies method names efficiently, providing valuable information without requiring extensive model training.
